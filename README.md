# PID controller

---

In this project I have tried to use my knowledge of Control Systems to implement a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track!

The simulator will provide you the cross track error (CTE) and the velocity (mph) in order to compute the appropriate steering angle.

## Output

## Parameter Selection
The error values for the P, I and D were chosen as follows:

**p_error** - chosen to be a very large value assuming the car starts far from the intended path

**i_error** - assume that the total sum of errors initially is extremely small as the car is yet to start

**d_error** - assume that the initial difference is small as the car is yet to start

**Initial P (Kp) - 0.150** - This parameter make the car move toward the CTE, by multiplying the CTE by P value.
The true value is never really achieved. It merely oscillates around it. 
I started with a value of 0.2 as given in the quiz. I then tweaked the value by increasing
it a bit and then decreasing it. Finally I stopped in 0.15 as there was not much difference in the driving behavior.

**Initial I (Ki) - 0.001** - This parameter compensates for the systematic bias, like a faulty alignment of the steering
wheel. It will accumulate the values of the errors and over time correct the car. I started with a value of 0.004 as 
given in the quiz. I then increased it to 0.01 and found that the car's oscillations increased. Therefor, I started
decreasing it gradually and found that 0.001 worked just fine.

**Initial D (Kd) - 2.5** - This parameter is for steering the car back to the course. It becomes smaller as the car 
drives towards the CTE. This avoids the over-shooting caused by the P controller alone. I started with a value
of 3.0 as given in the quiz. I increased it to 3.5 and found that the
result was not improving. I therefore experimented with decreasing it a bit and finally settled on 2.5.
